# Stroke Thickness and Labels

Scribbles must have thickness.
Single-pixel lines are not allowed.

Guidelines:
- Thickness scales with defect area
- Larger defects → thicker strokes
- Optionally support soft labels (0–1)
- Soft labels should decay with distance from stroke

This is critical to avoid line-only anomaly responses.
