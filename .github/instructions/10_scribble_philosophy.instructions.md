# Scribble Philosophy

Human scribble annotations are:
- Not strict skeletons
- Not random walks
- Somewhere in between

Design assumptions:
- Humans draw a few meaningful strokes
- Typically include:
  - One central stroke
  - One boundary-related stroke
- Large defects receive thicker or more strokes
- Defects are not fully filled

The goal is to represent defect regions,
not to exhaustively label them.
