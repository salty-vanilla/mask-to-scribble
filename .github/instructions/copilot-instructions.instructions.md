# Copilot Instructions (Entry Point)

This repository implements a Python package that generates
human-like scribble annotations from defect masks.

Before writing or modifying code, always read:
- copilot/00_project_scope.md
- copilot/10_scribble_philosophy.md
- copilot/20_algorithm_design.md

This package is intended to be imported from PU-SAC.
It is NOT an experimental script repository.
